Are you interested in helping grow the Tribes That May Be experience? There are plenty of ways you can help! If any of these things seem interested to you, contact us using one of the methods at the bottom of this page!

# Arists and Creators

We are looking for creators and artist who would like to see their written, spoken, musical, and visual art embedded in this multiverse zone trip experience.

# Developers

There is always a bit more to do to make the experience more engaging. There is plenty to do around building out the quest line, game balance, and texture manipulation.

# Testing

Sometimes testing involves a quiet playthrough. Sometimes it involves eldrich myst ages and high explosives. We have created a set of tools to make rapidly testing the modpack much more easy (and relatively fun) so let us know if this is your jam.
