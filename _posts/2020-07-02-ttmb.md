Tribes That May Be is a narrative heavy magical realism zone trip. It is built upon Minecraft v12.2 using a wide variety of enchancements from the extended modding community.

You start your journey in the scenic, if not always friendly, Block Rock Desert. What you choose to do is up to you. Some may explore, some may throw a party, some may simply create the fully automated luxury queer block utopia of their dreams.

So fill up your canteen, roll up your sleeping back, tame a coyote to be your pal, and set off on a zone trip.
