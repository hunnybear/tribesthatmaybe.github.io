Tribes That May Be is currently in a pre-release state. You can find the latest development artifacts on our modpack [actions page](https://github.com/tribesthatmaybe/modpack/actions?query=workflow%3Amake-modpack). For single player usage, you can generally download the most recent artifact that has been succesfully build. Make sure the build you are selecting has a green checkbox next to it.

Due to the variety of mods included in this pack you do need a very fresh version of Java installed. This involves going to the sketchy-looking-but-totally-legit [java dot com](https://www.java.com/) website and installing the latest for your platform.

## Twitch Launcher

idk something about custom profiles?

## MultiMC Launcher

The [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) launcher is much lighter weight than the more common Twitch launcher. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. After you have downloaded the MultiMC launcher and started it up, click on the `Add Instance` button in the upper right. From there, select `Import from zip` from the list on the left. Unfortunately you cannot just paste the artifact URL in the text field even though it implies you can. Click `Browse` and select the zip file of the `ttmb-client` artifact you downloaded previously.

Things will happen for a bit as the modpack dependencies are downloaded. Once that has completed, you can select the new icon and click `Launch`.
